    Calculates the number of edge pixels in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

    A higher edge count generally indicates a sharper or more detailed image.
    This metric can help assess image complexity and sharpness.

    Parameters:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file.
        threshold1 (int): Lower threshold for edge detection.
        threshold2 (int): Upper threshold for edge detection.
