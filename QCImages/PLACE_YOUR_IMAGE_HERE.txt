# PhotoQC Test Image Placeholder
# 
# This file represents where you should place your actual test image.
# The PhotoQC scripts will now automatically detect any image file you place in this folder.
#
# Supported formats (in order of preference for quality analysis):
# 1. TIFF (.tif, .tiff) - RECOMMENDED for best quality analysis
# 2. PNG (.png) - Lossless, good alternative  
# 3. JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - Acceptable but may show compression artifacts
#
# To test the PhotoQC scripts:
# 1. Remove this placeholder file
# 2. Add your test image to the QCImages folder
# 3. Run any PhotoQC analysis script
#
# The scripts will automatically find and analyze your image!
