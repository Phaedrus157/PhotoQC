    Estimates the blur in an image using Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.
    The metric is based on the difference between the original and deblurred image.
    A larger score indicates more blur.

    Parameters:

        num_iter (int): The number of iterations for the algorithm.
        psf_size (int): The initial guess for the PSF size.
